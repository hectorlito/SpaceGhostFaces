#Approach

First I worked on getting the animations set up through CSS and making sure that each object had a different path it followed. Then I worked on containing those variables and creating the surrounding css. After that I worked on giving it functionality, apart from being flying objects I needed to make them responsive to clicks. So I set up a click function that then transferred them to the completed box. Once I had functioning events I worked on timing it and I used methods that would run time in real time, and then showed the difference from the start and end time. I was also able to incorporate css that would help you determine the next action. For example, when you click the start button it would disappear and the animations would begin. Ideally this would be intuitive into what the user had to do next, which would be clicking the objects. Finally I was able to incorporate two players playing the game and compare the results between the two. I did this by giving them separate buttons that spoke to one another, therefore making it so that if player two wasn't able to start his round until player one finished.
